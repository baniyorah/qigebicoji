Of course, the premise of the TGIF staple was that Danny Tanner is a new widower. This leads to his best friend and brother-in-law moving in to help raise his three daughters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-the-original-tanners-looked-so-different-in-the-unaired-full-house-pilot>Why the Original Tanners Looked so Different in the Unaired ‘Full House’ Pilot</h2><p>The image certainly implies the original concept for Full House was much different. It appears that this is simply a production image, though. The unaired pilot episode of Full House is featured as a bonus on the season one DVD. However, the plot of the pilot remains essentially the same as the premiere episode, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Very First Show</a>“.</p><p>Actor John Posey played the role of Danny Tanner in the pilot because Bob Saget was already contracted as a host on CBS’ The Morning Program. Although Saget was the producers’ initial choice, he was unavailable for the pilot.</p><p>The photo featured Posey with an unidentified actress as his on-screen wife, Pamela Tanner. They were joined by Jodie Sweetin as Stephanie Tanner, Candace Cameron Bure as D.J. Tanner, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as Michelle Tanner.</p><p>Of course, it’s impossible for fans to imagine anyone but Bob Saget as Danny Tanner. From the autumn of 1987 to May 1995, Saget captivated audiences as the loving father of three on Full House. Alongside his onscreen daughters the Olsens, Bure, Sweetin, and John Stamos, Dave Coulier, and Lori Loughlin, his presence helped transform the iconic sitcom into a beloved series on television.</p><p>In 2016, Saget and the rest of the cast returned to portray their roles in Fuller House, a Netflix revival. Saget himself popped up on the spinoff in 10 episodes. The sequel series ended in 2020. In January 2022 Saget passed away tragically in his Orlando, Florida hotel room. The medical examiner of Orange County, Florida later determined that his untimely death resulted from an accidental fall, causing blunt head trauma.</p><p>You can stream Full House on Hulu, while Fuller House is available for streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51kwbd7xa6jpWWYpMK0sYysnJ5ln6e2qLXNmqNmrJGju6a%2B0maZnp6fp7JuwMeeZKygn6x6uK3SZqmerpGivaawjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
