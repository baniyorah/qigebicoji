The director openly acknowledged that, at the time, the age difference ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt seem too peculiar.‚Äù</p><p>When the observed age gaps were brought to Curtis‚Äôs attention, he admitted that the casting decisions might be approached differently today. After all, it‚Äôs not 2003 anymore.</p><p>Curtis wondered whether he would advise against such casting choices now. He noted that he probably wouldn‚Äôt have cast someone as young as Keira Knightley at the time. This acknowledgment hints at a shift in perspectives over the years regarding age-appropriate casting in the film industry.</p><p>A film like Love Actually would be hard to make now.
