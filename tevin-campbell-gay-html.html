In a now-deleted tweet, which was screenshotted by many celebrity gossip sites and fans, Campbell seemingly confirmed that he is gay.
He made the tweet while replying to a fan's tweet that read, &#34;My mom keep telling me Luther Vandross, Teddy Pendergrass, and Tevin Campbell were gay.&#34;

He also added a rainbow flag and a&nbsp;smiling face with sunglasses emojis. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Deleted Tweet, Fan Reactions, and More</h2><p>Campbell was quick to delete his tweet, where he&nbsp;seemingly came out of the closet, as soon as&nbsp;fans started reacting shockingly to it.</p><p>"This Isn't new to us," one commented on celebrity gossip and news site The Jasmine Brand's Instagram post. The media had shared the screenshotted tweet and reported the details in brief.</p><p>"It looks like the sexuality of one of our favorite 90’s R&B singers is being discussed," the post's caption read. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Another user chimed in, saying, "We knew...and we didn't care...We like his music...his personal life is his business.... See how that work?"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tevin Campbell puts up a ðŸ³ï¸‍ðŸŒˆ and y'all say he "finally came out."ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¿ If you're a fan you know those flags been on all his social media pages, he discussed this subject like 20yrs ago in a magazine AND he already told y'all he's not "gay" more than once ðŸ¤·ðŸ¾ — Virgo87 (@shennaf) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 14, 2022</a></p><p>Interestingly, even though the singer deleted the tweet, he went on to add a rainbow flag emoji in his&nbsp;Twitter bio on his verified account.</p><p>According to Dictionary.com, the rainbow flag is used to represent the <a href=# rel=follow>LGBTQ</a> community and is used to express Pride in this community. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>But Is Tevin Campbell Gay?</h2><p>Despite the speculations and the recent hints,&nbsp;Campbell has not openly confirmed that he is gay.</p><p>And the speculation about his sexuality has circulated for years and throughout his entire career. But he had never addressed it until now — and this time, too, he is unsure to speak out the truth.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>So, until the official confirmation, it would be unfair to describe him as gay. However, fans are convinced that he is.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Tevin Campbell Has Occasionally Teased Fans about His Sexuality</h2><p>Campbell hasn't entirely remained silent about the queries about his sexuality over the years. He has occasionally taken the opportunities and <a href=# rel="follow noopener">spoken</a> about the topic.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>For instance, during an interview with Sister 2 Sister in the past, he told Jamie Foster Brown that he was "try-sexual," which was a way of saying he was "open-minded."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I’m not gay, but there’s a lot of different things that I do like, sexually,” he said. “Being in the business, you are introduced to a lot of different things. I’m not gay, but I’m a freak and I think a lot of people know what a freak is.”</p><p>Back in 2009, he even told IMissTheOldSchool that his sexuality shouldn’t be of concern to others. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It’s nobody’s business what I like to do behind closed doors, just because I am a celebrity," Campbell stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"But if you happen to get to know me and we hit it off… I share a lot of personal things with friends, which is a normal thing to do."</p><p>To date, the singer hasn't been reported to have gotten&nbsp;married to a wife or any other partner as well. But he is definitely&nbsp;a heartthrob.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyVq7avecKapKmalaG5brPAsmWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
