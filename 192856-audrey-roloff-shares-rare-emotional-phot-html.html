Audrey shared photos of Bode after delivery, but this one is raw. The post is found below.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>Audrey's unadulterated reaction</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Post-delivery shots are common. Typically, though, they're done when the mom has partially recovered, looks more presentable than before, and their precious bundle is cleaned and wrapped.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Furthermore, the photos usually follow after the initial excitement has passed. On Tuesday, Audrey skipped all the niceties and gave fans a raw look at her reaction to holding baby Bode for the first time.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Audrey Roloff celebrates her new book 'A Love Letter Life' at Barnes & Noble at The Grove | Photo: Getty Images</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>Nothing can compare</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"It's unlike anything else," she <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IcYFIAIrZ/>wrote</a> in her caption. In the photo, Audrey stood next to husband Jeremy Roloff, 29, who had a smile on his face upon seeing his firstborn son.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>As for Audrey, 28, her mouth was open, and her head slightly tilted back. Although she didn't smile, she was grossly overwhelmed with positive emotions.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Jeremy Roloff and Audrey Roloff celebrate their new book 'A Love Letter Life' at Barnes & Noble at The Grove | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In her arms was a newly delivered boy named Bode, with a blanket nearby in his mother's arms. This little bundle gave his mom pure joy that was impossible for anyone to miss.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>Fans can relate</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Audrey informed fans in her caption that she'd be speaking to the Behind the Scenes podcast about her experience with Bode's birth. She advised them to subscribe.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In the comments, other women related to the mother-of-two. "This picture made me cry," said one fan among many who were moved by the photo.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>The meaning of Bode</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial><a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/audrey-and-jeremy-roloffs-baby-name-meaning-is-sweet-bode-james/>Last week</a>, Audrey and Jeremy revealed the meaning behind their newborn's name. As people of faith, one reason they selected Bode (pronounced "bo-dee") was that it means messenger.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The couple would like to see their son spread the Gospel when he gets bigger. The name is also a nod to Audrey's maiden name, Botti.
