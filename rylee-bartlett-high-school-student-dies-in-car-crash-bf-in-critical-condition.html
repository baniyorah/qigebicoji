The incident took place just after 5.30 pm as Rylee Bartlett lost her life. Her partner Brady Niver, who was in the passenger's seat at the time, also suffered injuries and was taken to Upstate Hospital by first responders where he is in critical condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Rylee and Brady were in a relationship and were classmates at G Ray Bodley High School in Fulton. Jeff Waldron is the President of the Fulton Wrestling Club where he first met the Bartlett family. Jeff said that Derek, Rylee's father and a Fulton alum, played a crucial role to build the club as it exists today. The club sits on the land donated by him on Emery Street and it's where Jeff met Rylee, who helped keep score during wrestling matches.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Lily Oxford: Ex-Big Lots manager claims she was fired for 'following a thief outside' to recover goods</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'She did an amazing job': Off-duty nurse saves two girls with timely CPR after they fall in pool at party</a></p><p>The president also served as a coach for Brady who he said gave him a pleasant surprise as he quit basketball to start wrestling. He called Brady one of the strongest members of his program. "I honestly believe that the strength he's gotten from preparing to be a wrestler is going to help him pull through this," he said according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CNY Central.&nbsp;</a>Waldron also called Rylee a brilliant student beyond her capabilities as an athlete who could always be found on the field, polishing her lacrosse skills. "They're great people. You can tell they were raised well," he said.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Support for two families</h2><p>"This tragedy will have a profound impact on our entire community. We encourage you to call your child’s school if you feel they need any additional support as they process this news," Fulton City School District Superintendent Brian Pulvino sent a message to the community Sunday evening. Many students stayed at home the following day according to a school official.&nbsp;</p><p>Waldron said that both the Bartletts and the Nivers are synonymous with Fulton. He added, "They're everywhere. They care about our community, and our community has to show their support for these two families."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>The authorities are investigating the incident</h2><p>The exact cause of the tragic incident is being investigated by the Oswego County Sheriff's Office. An investigator claimed that no traces of alcohol were found to be involved in the crash.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqqmhsqZ5wZqpraSVqcFutMign2ark528sLiMrKuunJWjwW6wyJ6qZqGeYrCivoycqZqrmGKvp3nIp2ScqpmptqSty2aaqKaUnsGqu80%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
