I was looking back at some of the edits from my husband [Alexandre Rockwell] and saw myself and thought, ‘Oh shoot.’ Did I really? Yikes.”</p><p class=Fg>Parsons also gave a short description of the film, saying:</p><p class=Fg>“My kids play my kids. It’s been a good experience. It’s about these kids who have a dysfunctional and alcoholic father, played by Will Patton — he’s amazing. He loves his kids, but he is in no shape… he’s grappling with his alcoholism and his sadness.”</p><p class=Fg>And continued:</p><p class=Fg>“The kids end up having to stay with their mother for the summer, and it’s a bad place. Her new boyfriend is not a great guy. It’s a bad situation. But the kids end up meeting this other kid and they kind of begin to explore this new adventure together that they needed. They have a hard life. It’s a beautiful story. It’s really poetic, to be honest.”</p><p class=Fg>Although the movie already wrapped its filming stage, Rockwell and company are now looking forward to the tricky process of post-production.</p><p class=Fg>And since the acclaimed director has earned a cultish reputation among indie film lovers, they’re counting on fans to raise the required money to take the film to its next level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/49af76188612f92c19e22594aeee302c1526891555035439.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Alexandre Rockwell during the In the Soup (1992) panel at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival. | Source: Wikimedia Commons Images</p><p class=Fg>Parsons and Rockwell created a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?fbclid=IwAR23wG2lASZ0ISsDULXIModWXWdwe3ZcGjH98R23BBExAMPrrfxnJ13mLRU/">Kickstarter</a> to raise funds for the project, which they expect to release in 2020.</p><p class=Fg>Among some of the <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?fbclid=IwAR23wG2lASZ0ISsDULXIModWXWdwe3ZcGjH98R23BBExAMPrrfxnJ13mLRU/">rewards</a> for donating, there are: getting associate producer credits on the film, coffee dates with Rockwell and Parsons, and even a dinner experience with the entire cast and crew of “Sweet Thing.”</p><p class=Fg>Hopefully, the funds will come along, as fans are excited to watch Parsons in action after all of these years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmprbXBpaXqzscyepJudomK1qrjAq7BmnqKawKl5z6ugp5uVYq%2BmuIyaoKtlo52yb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
