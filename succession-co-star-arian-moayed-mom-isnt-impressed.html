The Iranian-born actor, 41, who came to the US following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, says that his mother is most proud of her other son who is every immigrant parents’ dream: a doctor.
“Even being in a show like ‘Succession’ my mom still leads with, ‘He’s a doctor,'” Moayed said leading into Sunday night’s season premiere on HBO."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He’s the only person in Season 2 who asked Kendall how he was doing. So, in a way, I think he will always be Team Kendall because they’re buddies … but he will tell you, ‘I’m going to pick the team that’s going to win a little bit more than you are.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/arian-moayed-32.jpg><p>And as for who Stewie will support this season, Moayed obviously can’t spill the beans. “I think he’s doing what everyone else is doing and figuring out who’s going to win,” he said. One thing you’ve got to give Stewie is [that] he’s going to go after the person who is going to win it all. Watching this season and [watching] Stewie maneuver, he’s going to maintain that position.”</p><p>Moayed, who was nominated for a Tony for his role in “Bengal Tiger At The Baghdad Zoo” opposite Robin Williams, also has a role in what he jokingly refers to as a little indie movie called “Spider-Man: No Way Home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/arian-moayed-30.jpg><p>Acting in the sure-to-be blockbuster opposite Tom Holland was “very cool. I can say I had some of the most magical moments working alongside those brilliant actors. I think it’s going to blow people’s minds, truly, it’s going to be epic.”</p><p>He said he also realized the importance of being Persian-American and appearing in the Marvel universe — calling it a “big deal for Iranians.”</p><p>Since Moayed began acting close to 20 years ago, he’s made it a rule to always say no to “terrorist parts and victims because we’re not victims either, we’re hungry, smart, and trying to make the world work.</p><p>“My family escaped war and a comfortable middle-class life to come to this country to give me an opportunity to do things,” he said. “I’ve made it my duty to change the myths and all the bulls–t that is out there about our people.</p><p>“You probably know Iranians that are super-kind [and] generous, but if you look at the media we look like whatever-the-hell they put out there … so I do feel a huge sense of responsibility.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGlmam1fqMKkr8SsqqKnnmKwsHnSrZirZZGntqK6jKammrGVmXquu8xmoKympGK2rrzRnqqsnZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
