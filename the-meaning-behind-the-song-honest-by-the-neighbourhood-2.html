The lyrics, delivered with haunting vocals by lead singer Jesse Rutherford, resonated deeply with me as I grappled with the complexities of honesty within a partnership.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Struggle_With_Honesty></span>The Struggle With Honesty<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The song opens with the lyrics, “Patience, test my patience. If I made it too hard for you, maybe you should’ve changed it.” These lines convey the frustration and self-reflection that arise when we question whether we have contributed to the difficulties in a relationship. It prompts us to consider whether the lack of honesty stems from our own actions.</p><p>Continuing into the chorus, The Neighbourhood sings, “I wish you could be honest with me, with me.” This plea for honesty reflects the universal desire for open communication, vulnerability, and transparency in relationships. It speaks to the pain of feeling deceived or misled by someone we deeply care about.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Weight_of_Deception></span>The Weight of Deception<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The second verse brings up the haunting question of why someone would choose to stay in a relationship if they were not truly committed. It speaks directly to the feelings of betrayal and confusion experienced when deception is uncovered. The lyrics hold the weight of disappointment and the hope for clarity.</p><p>The chorus is repeated multiple times throughout the song, emphasizing the yearning for honesty. It is a plea for the other person to reveal their true self, no matter how difficult it may be. The repetition of this chorus reflects the significance of this plea and the importance placed on genuine communication.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Reflection_and_Power_of_Change></span>Personal Reflection and Power of Change<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As I listened to “Honest” during those difficult times in my life, it became a source of solace and a reminder that change can be incredible. The pre-chorus, “I hope you find a way to be yourself someday, in weakness or in strength,” serves as a powerful message of self-acceptance and growth.</p><p>The song encourages both parties to embrace their true selves and recognizes that change, even when painful, can lead to something amazing. It acknowledges the possibility of personal development and the power of authenticity in relationships.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=About_The_Song></span>About The Song<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Honest” was produced by Jesse Rutherford, Zach Abels, Jeremy Freedman, and Mikey Margott.
