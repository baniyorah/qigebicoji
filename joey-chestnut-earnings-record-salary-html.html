This particular eating contest is held every year on 4th of July as a celebration of America’s independence day. He has been the longest runner in the competition with the maximum win. And he kept up the victory by winning 2018' contest as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eating His Way To Victory</strong>:&nbsp;Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut gets an epic introduction and then breaks his own record by eating 74 hot dogs for his 11th career title&nbsp;(Published: 4 July 2018) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Shay Mitchell Responds To Gay/Lesbian Rumors | Boyfriend Status At Age 31" rel=follow>Shay Mitchell Responds To Gay/Lesbian Rumors | Boyfriend Status At Age 31</a></p><p>The American native’s appetite is not only for the hot dogs. He entered in the competition for the first time munching down on deep-fried asparagus. He has set records for eating chicken wings, burritos, doughnuts, apple pie, gumbo, poutine, hamburgers and you name it.</p><h3><strong>Joey Chestnut’s Bio (Age): Left Job To Eat</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>Joey was born on 25 November 1983 in&nbsp;Fulton County, Kentucky to parents Merlin Chestnut and Alicia Chestnut. He is currently of age 34, but he’ll soon celebrate his 35th birthday in November of 2018. And if he throws a birthday party, it is likely that he’ll devour all the cake by himself.</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The eating pro was not born to be an eater. He has a degree in civil engineering from San Jones State University, and before dedicating his full time for eating competitions, he used to receive earnings from a job in construction management. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>Having landed in eating gig in 2005 while he was still an engineering student, he decided to hold on to it, and in 2011 he quit his job to become a full-time eater. The quit is justified for all the genuine reasons as he is paid for eating and seemingly he counts frequent earnings as the winner of several eating competitions.</p><h3><strong>Joey Chestnut Found Eater Girlfriend Who Nearly Turned Into Wife</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>It’s not a big surprise that the food lover would love a woman who loves food as much as he does.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Don't Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Nolan Gould Defying Gay Rumors?
