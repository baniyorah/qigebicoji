The seller, according to Mansion Global, was listed as Lourdes Sanjenis, who had owned the spread since at least 2013. The identity of the new owner isn’t known. However, Eber told Mansion Global that the dollar figure of the sale proves the “ever-growing popularity” of Miami’s real estate market.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">The property hit the market in August for $80 million, which made it the priciest listing in town. <span class=credit>Berkshire Hathaway Home Services</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">There’s plenty of room inside for entertaining. <span class=credit>Berkshire Hathaway Home Services</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Star Island, home to celebs like Sean “Diddy” Combs, has about 30 homes. <span class=credit>Berkshire Hathaway Home Services</span></figure><p>This purchase breaks the previous record, set in 2015, by $15 million.
