He is widely known for being one of the co-founders of Facebook, a popular online social networking service. Eduardo Saverin was born on March 19th, 1982 in São Paulo, Brazil. His father, Roberto Saverin, was an industrialist while his mother, Paula Saverin, worked as a psychologist. He comes from a Jewish background and his grandfather, Eugenio, was the founder of the Tip Top chain. In 1993, his family moved to Miami, Florida, where Eduardo attended high school and later pursued studies at Harvard University, where he met Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>During his time at Harvard, he was part of the Harvard Investment Association, and even before graduating, he managed to earn $300,000 through smart investments in oil companies. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Economics in 2006, he became an integral part of Facebook’s founding team. He, along with Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, played a crucial role in the early days of Facebook, with Eduardo providing the initial funds and earning a third of the company’s shares.</p><p>Despite his instrumental role in the company’s early days, conflicts arose, and he faced legal challenges that ultimately led to a significant reduction in his ownership of the company. However, he made strategic investments in other companies such as Qwiki and Jumio, which also contributed to his net worth. Eduardo’s story was immortalized in the movie “The Social Network,” with Andrew Garfield portraying his character.</p><p>Apart from his involvement in Facebook, Eduardo’s net worth is also attributed to his investments and business ventures. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2011 reportedly to avoid taxes after Facebook’s initial public offering, a move that was estimated to have saved him $700 million in taxes, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Eduardo Saverin’s net worth stands at a remarkable $4.9 billion, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmicna2Rp7GwedKarZ6qmaN6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
