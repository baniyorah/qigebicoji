The rollercoaster trial at the time chronicled shocking tales of obsessive behavior and sultry sex, recalling the plot of the Michael Douglas-Glenn Close blockbuster 'Fatal Attraction'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/dec029fa-337e-4590-9808-45b4f8c40921.png><p>Many compared Warmus to Close's bunny-boiling character in the movie, where she shared an illicit romance with Douglas whose character is already married.</p><p>At the time of the incident, Warmus was a 23-year-old schoolteacher having an affair with Paul Solomon, who was 17 years older than her and already married. According to prosecutors, Warmus met Solomon for cocktails at a hotel bar after killing her romantic rival. They later had sex in his car.</p><p>It also came to light that the defendant stalked Solomon and his new paramour eight months after the murder as the pair vacationed in Puerto Rico. At first, investigators suspected that the husband was the killer. However, Warmus was eventually indicted 13 months after the crime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/029687f4-368e-461b-b7a6-aaad274d171e.jpeg><p>The headline-grabbing case first saw Warmus resolutely declare her innocence after an initial hung jury. In 1992, a second trial finally led to her conviction on charges including second-degree murder.</p><p>Disgraced private investigator Vincent Parco became a key prosecution witness in the case. Parco testified in court that Warmus paid him $2,500 for a silencer-equipped .25-caliber Beretta Jetfire pistol just days before the killing.</p><p>While Warmus has left prison, Parco remains locked up at the Brooklyn Detention Complex on a sentence of one to three years for attempting to blackmail a witness in a child abuse case. According to prosecutors, Parco manipulated the man with prostitutes and recorded their sexual encounters on a device. He later threatened the witness with the tapes to ensure his silence.</p><p>Warmus is the second high profile release from Bedford Hills this year. Former radical Judith Clark was released from the same prison two months earlier.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonpGprq15wK2rq5mTqbawuoykoKWklad6pK3RqKOypl2srrO51Kxkq52cmq60sYynnLBlqaS%2FrHnPq6Csp55if3h52J6Yq6tdosKzsMSrZKWnppq%2FbsPIn5w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
