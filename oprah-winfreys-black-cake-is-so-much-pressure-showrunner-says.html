Covey (Mia Isaac), a 17-year-runaway bride who is half-Jamaican and half-Chinese, sprints on a beach at night.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Showrunner Marissa Jo Cerar. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Showrunner Marissa Jo Cerar (left) with the book’s author, Charmaine Wilkerson (right). <span class=credit>HULU</span></figure><p>In the present day, a gray-haired woman, Eleanor Bennett (Chipo Chung), sits contemplating her life on a beach in California.&nbsp;</p><p>After Eleanor dies, her estranged adult children — ocean scientist Byron (Ashley Thomas) and artist Benny (Adrienne Warren) — go to attorney Charles Mitch (Glynn Turman) to deal with their mother’s estate.&nbsp;</p><p>To their surprise, it’s not a routine will reading.

To see a cast of main characters who were diverse — half-black, half-Chinese, queer, a Chinese immigrant in Jamaica, a black ocean scientist in Orange County — to see this group of characters as the leads of the story about their family history was so exciting to me.</p><p>“And it’s a fun murder mystery, so that we could have something as juicy and premium as ‘Little Fires Everywhere,’ or ‘Big Little Lies.’”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Mia Isaac as Covey in the past timeline, as she starts a new life after fleeing her unwanted wedding. <span class=credit>HULU</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Byron (Ashley Thomas) and his mom, Eleanor (Chipo Chung), as an older woman in the present, shortly before her death. <span class=credit>HULU</span></figure><p>The show’s title comes from a Caribbean dish that also draws influences from British cuisine, marrying different cultures, just as the family depicted in the show is a melting pot of different influences.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have never baked it, but I have eaten it,” said Cerar. “I had some great black cake in Wales, and I had it in Jamaica. Before reading this book, I had never heard of it.
