Five years ago, Emile Cilliers made headlines for his shocking attempt to end the life of his wife Victoria, which unfolded in a dark conspiracy involving tampering with her parachute.</p><p>During the trial, it came to light that he had plotted to collect her life insurance and use the money to start a new chapter with a lover.

On a Sunday morning in 2015, Victoria, an experienced parachuting instructor, jumped from an aircraft at 4,000 feet, only for both her main and reserve parachutes to fail, leading to a near-fatal accident. Subsequent police investigations revealed that Cilliers had not only tampered with the parachute but had also attempted to murder her by damaging the gas valve at their Wiltshire house.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Emile-Cilliers-1.jpg alt="Emile Cilliers" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Victoria’s keen awareness saved her from the gas leak, which foreshadowed the parachute disaster.
