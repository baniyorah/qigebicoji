The 24-year-old, real name Saraya-Jade Bevis, was issued a 60-day suspension in October for her second violation of the wrestling company’s anti-drug Talent Wellness Program. She has previously denied taking illegal substances, despite getting hit with a 30-day suspension last August after her first violation.
However, in the latest episode of “Total Divas,” she revealed what she says is the real reason she was banned."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Filmed last year, Paige had just learned of her suspension from the WWE and broke down crying.</p><p>“WWE posted a statement about me failing the wellness policy,” she said. “We get drug tested all the time&nbsp;… first of all, I don’t do drugs. Second of all, I did the test and I passed it. They’re only suspending me because I didn’t take it in the allotted time that they gave me.”</p><p>That incident started several months of hell for the British wrestler — who is currently on hiatus due to injury.</p><p>Earlier this year, explicit images and videos of the former Divas champion engaging in sex acts with two separate male wrestlers were leaked online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/042017-wwe-paige-1.jpg><p>Paige, who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the focus of a Hollywood film</a> being made by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, is seen in one of the clips using her former title belt <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a sordid act</a>.</p><p>At least things now seem to be looking up for Paige, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently married former WWE star Alberto Del Rio</a>.</p><p>Speaking prior to tying the knot with the Mexican star, who has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly defended his partner</a>, Paige admitted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she thought of harming herself</a> as her world crumbled.</p><p>“I made a big mistake. Huge. I put trust in the hands of someone that took advantage of a young girl years ago,” she said. “It was my mistake and I’ll always take responsibility — but the one thing that was the hardest was thinking ‘my husband is gonna leave me, my family will disown me.’ But I’m blessed beyond words to have a family and a husband that stuck by me because they know who I am.</p><p>“They know I’m not a bad person and they held my hands through hell. Because as my husband says, ‘You may feel like the devil is throwing you into a storm, but just remember, you are the storm.’ And he’s right. But we are human. Unfortunately, people don’t see it that way when they are behind a keyboard. They don’t think that we have feelings or that we don’t suffer. Not only was I a victim of viral humiliation, but a victim of cyber-bullying. I had days where I wanted to physically harm myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21ma2hfqbWqv4yiqmavmJq%2FpnnToZxmppmctbW5wKucZpqVnK6vecWoqWavp5p6tMDAq2SpmZmcsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
