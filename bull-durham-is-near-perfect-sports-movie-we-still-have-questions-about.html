The beloved Kevin Costner classic receives our full endorsement as the funniest depiction of minor league baseball ever made, even if a few questions always have persisted since first seeing it over 30 years ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Susan Sarandon also stars as Annie Savoy, a lifelong baseball groupie who romances and also imparts wisdom to LaLoosh, although Crash ultimately gets the girl in the end.</p><p>“Bull Durham” — ranked the No.5 sports movie all time by the American Film Institute — even might have earned our first perfect rating in this series. But like many sports flicks, there are a few plot points that only would happen through the Hollywood lens.</p><p>For instance, we are told that LaLoosh strikes out 18 and walks 18 — both league records! — in his first professional start, which would be a minimum of 126 pitches and likely closer to 200. No chance, even then.</p><p>Also, after overcoming several poor starts, under Crash’s and Annie’s tutelage Nuke finally wins a few games and immediately gets the call to make the direct jump from Single-A to the majors?</p><p>As Davis would advise, “Don’t think. It can only hurt the ballclub.”</p><p><strong>Quote of Note:</strong> “OK, well, candlesticks always make a nice gift, and maybe you could find out where she’s registered and maybe a place-setting or a silverware pattern. OK, let’s get two!” — pitching coach Larry Hockett (Robert Wuhl), discussing the upcoming wedding of one of the players during a meeting on the mound.</p><p><strong>Botte Blows:</strong> 4.7 of 5</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j21maW5fl8KtuIydrKugkaJ6qr%2BMp5yaql2lsrOyxJyrZqugpL%2B1v4ympq%2BhlWLEpnnSraClpF2drrexjKqsnquknryvv4yamaitpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
