Schmitz, 95, of Tower Hill, who peacefully passed away on December 23, 2023, at his residence. Born on September 5, 1928, in Shelby County, IL, Eugene was the beloved son of the late Winand and Ludvina (Nold) Schmitz. He shared a beautiful union with Jean Swiney, marrying on July 7, 1956, at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church. His beloved Jean preceded him in death on October 1, 2015.</p><p>Eugene’s journey was marked by remarkable experiences and unwavering service. Educated at Sandy Hill School, he honorably served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, later receiving the esteemed privilege of participating in the Land of Lincoln Honor Flight, a testament to his dedication to his country. Throughout his life, Eugene’s commitment extended to various community organizations: St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, Pana Knights of Columbus, Pana VFW Post #4431, the Tower Hill High School Board of Education for two decades, and the Moultry/Shelby FS Board for 11 years.</p><p>Professionally, Eugene’s endeavors were diverse, from his tenure at Caterpillar to operating a sawmill for 28 years, specializing in custom sawing until passing the reins to his son five years ago. Primarily a farmer, Eugene found joy in collecting coins, stamps, and tractors, showcasing his passion for varied interests and woodworking.</p><p>Eugene’s legacy transcends his accomplishments; he was a beacon of integrity, hard work, and selflessness. A devoted husband and loving father, he exemplified a life dedicated to setting an exemplary standard for others without expecting anything in return.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsdSgnKedXaiwqbnIrbFmp5Kewbat0bJkmmWTnbKztdKhnJ1lo6TCrXnHmqpmq5GZubp5w6KcnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
