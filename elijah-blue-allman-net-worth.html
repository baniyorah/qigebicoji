Exeter Blue, was born on the 10th July 1976, in Los Angeles, California USA, and is a musician, guitarist and singer, best known as a son of <a href=#>Cher</a> and <a href=#>Gregg Allman</a>, and a member of the heavy metal band called Deadsy. Allman’s career started in 1995.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Elijah Blue Allman is, as of 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Allman’s net worth is as high as $15 million, earned through his successful career in music. In addition to being a member of the rock band, Allman has worked on other projects, and the fact that he is a son of famous singer <a href=#>Cher</a>&nbsp;has pretty much secured his financial status.</p><h3>Elijah Blue Allman Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Elijah Blue Allman&nbsp; is a half-brother of Delilah Island Allman, Michael Allman, Devon Allman, Layla Allman, and <a href=#>Chaz Bono</a>. His first guitar was given to him by the Kiss bassist <a href=#>Gene Simmons</a>, and he subsequently accompanied his mother during her tour in 1989, including appearing in her video “If I could Turn Back Time”.</p><p>Allman had an audition for Nine Inch Nails guitarist in 1994, but was turned down for Robin Finck. In 1995, Allman, <a href=#>Alec Puro</a>, and Renn Hawkey founded the band called Deadsy, and soon after signed a deal with Sire Records, releasing their self-titled debut album in 1996; due to the lack of a bassist in the group, Blue asked Jay Gordon to join them for a few tracks. They had their first live performance at Coney Island in 1997, but left the stage after only three songs for unclarified reasons.</p><p>The band had problems in securing a new deal with the record company, and they were unable to release their second album before <a href=#>Jonathan Davis</a> (of the band Korn) helped them to sign a deal with Elementree Records in 2001, and the album called “Commencement” finally saw daylight in May 2002. Davis featured in two songs while Limp Bizkit’s frontman <a href=#>Fred Durst</a> directed the video for the song “The Key to Gramercy Park”. Although the band collaborated with big names such as <a href=#>Durst</a> and <a href=#>Davis</a>, sales failed to meet expectations, and Deadsy sold only around 175,000 copies, and peaked at No. 100 position on the Billboard 200 chart. Regardless, Allman’s net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>Deadsy needed four more years before releasing their next album; they signed a contract with Immortal Records and recorded their latest album called “Phantasmagore” in 2006. Again, it failed to achieve major commercial success, but did reach No. 176 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band then joined the Family Values Tour in summer 2006 as a backup to the Deftones and Korn, but in January 2007, Deadsy announced their hiatus; recently there were some rumours about their reunion, but nothing has happened thus far.</p><p>Allman has collaborated with other musicians and bands such as Orgy, <a href=#>Cher</a>, Sugar Ray, and Coal Chamber in 1999, Limp Bizkit in 2001, Thirty Seconds to Mars in 2002, Korn in 2005, and <a href=#>Mickey Avalon</a> in 2012, which certainly increased his net worth. In 2008, Elijah released three songs with Elijah Blue and the Trapezoids: “Haunted”, “White Knuckle Angel Face”, and “Long Way Down”, but since then, there have been no new releases.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Elijah Blue Allman dated <a href=#>Bijou Phillips</a>, <a href=#>Heather Graham</a>, <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>, and <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> before marrying the English singer Marieangela “Queenie” King in December 2013; they currently live in Germany.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=29.897915168943><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Elijah Blue Allman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 10, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Beverly Hills, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, guitarist, singer, son of Cher and Greg Allman, member of the heavy metal band "Deadsy"</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Marieangela King (m. 2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Gregg Allman, Cher</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Chaz Bono, Devon Allman, Delilah Island Allman, Layla Brooklyn Allman, Michael Sean Allman</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nicknames</td><td>Allman, Elijah Blue , Exeter , elijah_blue_allman , Elijah Allman , P.
