She graduated cum laude, and then while studying for an MBA, discovered her passion for tattoo artistry. After graduating, she decided to fully pursue a career in the field, and in a short time, she earned a reputation as a respected tattoo artist, and so decided to move to New York City to expand to a larger audience, and she was hired by the popular tattoo shop “Black Ink”. She is the only female tattoo artist employed by the company, and over time they all became part of the television series “Black Ink Crew”.
