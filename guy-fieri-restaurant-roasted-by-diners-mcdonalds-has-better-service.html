Guy Fieri’s restaurant in Las Vegas is being slammed by customers who say the service is worse than at McDonald’s.
The 55-year-old celebrity chef — who is estimated to be worth $197 million — opened his first restaurant in Santa Rosa, California, in 1996 with Johnny Garlic’s, a pasta restaurant.
Now, he has restaurants across America, including a delivery-only eatery called Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Kitchen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not a hello, ignoring any questions we had for him,” they wrote.</p><p>The review continued, “I mentioned to him, with his lack of empathy, you work in hospitality and you’re being hostile, if you don’t want us to dine at your establishment then please ask us to leave. I won’t allow you to ever treat me or anyone that travel across the world to dine here feel unwelcome. Total disappointment and shame to such a great brand.”</p><p>Despite the rudeness from the host, the diner said that their waiter turned their experience around.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A customer claimed they were greeted with a “cold shoulder” and seated with a “disgusting attitude.” <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The restaurant responded to the review, writing, “Thank you for your review.

Thank you sir, but the host [name removed], is more than welcome to find work elsewhere if he doesn’t like his job,” they wrote.</p><p>The restaurant responded to the review, writing, “Thank you for your review.

Even the management, Armando, wasn’t really helpful. It’s sad as a local this is my first time here and I was not pleased. The food was good but cold,” she continued.</p><p>Some commented on the food, saying that it was “bland” and dry.”</p><p>“Disappointing. Guy spends so much time going around the country praising folks for their great scratch cooking. Yet at his own place the food was bland, dry and possibly even processed frozen food,” one customer lamented.</p><p>“I had the reuben which was dry and the chicken sandwich, which we could’ve sworn was a frozen breast. It needed seasoning as it was very bland. They went and got good bread but everything else was average at best. We tried it, and will not be going back. With his brand we expected so much more.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">One diner shared that she went with a party of 10 for a friend’s birthday, explaining, “People made reservations, and understood it was very busy.
