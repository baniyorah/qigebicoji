Mo, the 16-year-old teen, undergoes the regular pressure and stress that high school has to offer. As he tries his best to navigate the journey with ample naivete, Mo finds himself following the guidance of his best friend Zeke, who makes things inconvenient by starting to teach Mo some not-so-called-for life lessons in dealing drugs and of course, the whole concept of sex.</p><h2 class=split>Creator</h2><p>Jason Orley makes his directorial debut with the Hulu movie, along with writing the script for it too. Orley is also known for his work in 'The Intern' (2015), and 'It's Complicated' (2009).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7918b5e6-b162-449b-b844-187a908dc65a.jpg><h2 class=split>Cast</h2><p>Davidson appears in the movie as the college dropout gone worse - Zeke, with Griffin Gluck starring as his little protege, Mo Colson Baker, aka rapper Machine Gun Kelly, Emily Arlook, Thomas Barbusca, Oona Laurence, and Euphoria's Sydney Sweeney also star.</p><h2 class=split>Trailer</h2><p>One of the easily funniest moments from the full-length trailer for 'Big Time Adolescence' sees Mo being presented with a briefcase full of marijuana, courtesy Zeke. The smart, but naive Mo asks in sheer awe and confusion: “You think I’m just gonna walk into a party and everyone’s gonna wanna buy pot from me?” To that, Zeke responds in classic Davidson style and exhaling a giant breath of vape smoke, saying: “Call me crazy..." and lets it just trail off.</p><p><strong>Catch the full trailer here:</strong></p><h2 class=split>If you like this, you will love these:</h2><p>'Ladybird'</p><p>'Love, Simon'</p><p>'To All the Boys 2: PS I Still Love You'</p><p>'Dude'</p><p>'Call Me by Your Name'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRompmcerW1zJ5kmpyfobK0r8Snmp5lopq5pq3SnmSdmaSaerG4zq1knJmjqXq1vsCio56qXaWytbGMnZivoZSovK95x66jrmWdpMOqsYycpqahnpx6sLKMmp6eZZOkuqaw2A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
