God couldn’t have blessed me with 2 better sons and one on the way .thank u lord.”</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>HIS PARENTS' HISTORY</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Julez is the only son Daniel shares with Solange. The former spouses had Julez when the singer was only 18. They married in February 2004, just months before Julez was born. His birthday is on October 18, 2004.</p><p class=dh>Solange and Daniel stayed married for only three years. It came to a point that Solange <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2017/02/10/solange-relocating-for-ex-was-bittersweet/>felt isolated and alone</a>. She had been solely taking care of Julez when they moved to Idaho with Daniel who attended school there. Solange’s career took a backseat at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/819af1c7f442be17899c5f28cbdc26d7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Solange Knowles and her son, Julez Smith attending an event in May 2014. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>THEIR FRIENDLY ARRANGEMENT</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Though their marriage didn’t prosper, Solange and Daniel managed to become friendly co-parents.</p><p class=dh>“We co-parent really well. I’m able to say, ‘I need to finish this album, can you step up and take care of the boy?'” Solange <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a1835/solange-knowles-0414/>said</a> in 2014 in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar.</p><p class=dh>Though Julez grew up mostly with his mother, Daniel constantly sees him. Father and son would often bond as evident in Daniel’s social media feeds.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Solange, who recently split from her husband, <a class="me a" href=#>Alan Ferguson</a>, is a hands-on mother who makes Julez her number one priority. She uprooted from Brooklyn to New Orleans to ensure her son kept a stable set of friends and environment.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>MORE ON JULEZ</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Julez has already been showing interest in venturing into music like his mother but Solange is hesitant. If she had her way, she’d want him to be a diplomat.</p><p class=dh>This may also be the reason why she encouraged him to learn French. She told a fan who inquired about <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/solange-responds-fan-who-questions-why-her-son-speaks-french/>Julez’s fluency in the language</a> that it would help him connect with people when he travels to Africa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwcW9kanq0u8uapaCdXaC7sMPLnqpmq5%2Bjeqmt0maeq6eno3qieceapZ2rn6Kyb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
